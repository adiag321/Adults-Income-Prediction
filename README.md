# Data Defination
Here we have an person’s income prediction dataset. 
This dataset has 48842 rows × 15 columns


# Methods
Step 1: Data collection

Step 2: Data Cleaning

Step 3: Data Analysis

Step 4: Data Preprocessing(Preparation)

Step 5: Model Training

Step 6: Performance Evaluation

# Model Evaluation
We have implemented the following models:
1. SVM
2. Logistic Regression
3. Naive Bayes
4. Desicion Tree
5. Random Forest

# Performance Evaluation
We have calculated the precision, recall , True positive/negative and built a confusion matrix for the same.

# Conclusion:
Only a few of the traits are closely associated to income projection, according to the correlation table. <br>
The choice of such columns has a big impact on the model's accuracy. Random Forest is also the best fit for this dataset. Males have a higher rate of incorrect predictions than females. <br>
The dataset does not have to be perfect or small all of the time. As a result, we must define a method, a method that can be applied to every dataset. <br>
Here is a step-by-step explanation of the workflow, which you may apply to your own dataset. <br>
Also, different types of visualizations effectively portray data based on a combination of attribute types (numerical, categorical) and a classification technique that is totally reliant on the dataset.
