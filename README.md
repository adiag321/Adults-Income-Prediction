# <p align = "center"> Adult's Income Prediction </p>

This data was extracted from the 1994 Census bureau database by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker (Data Mining and Visualization, Silicon Graphics). A set of reasonably clean records was extracted using the following conditions: ((AAGE>16) && (AGI>100) && (AFNLWGT>1) && (HRSWK>0)). <br>
The prediction task is to determine whether a person makes over $50K a year.

# Data Defination

# Methods
In this project, we have employed the following steps:

1. Data Collection
2. Data Cleaning
3. Data Analysis
4. Data Preprocessing(Preparation)
5. Model Training
6. Performance Evaluation

We have implemented the following models: <br>

1. SVM
2. Logistic Regression
3. Naive Bayes
4. Desicion Tree
5. Random Forest

# Performance Evaluation
We have calculated the `Precision`, `Recall` , `True positive/negative` for all the models and built a `Confusion Matrix` for the same.

# Results
1. Gender Distribution based on Income

2. Education Count

3. Work-Class Distribution

4. Age Vs Marital Status

# Conclusion:
* Only a few of the traits are closely associated to income projection, according to the correlation table. <br>
* The choice of such columns has a big impact on the model's accuracy. Random Forest is also the best fit for this dataset. Males have a higher rate of incorrect predictions than females. <br>
* The dataset does not have to be perfect or small all of the time. As a result, we must define a method, a method that can be applied to every dataset. <br>
* Here is a step-by-step explanation of the workflow, which you may apply to your own dataset. <br>
* Also, different types of visualizations effectively portray data based on a combination of attribute types (numerical, categorical) and a classification technique that is totally reliant on the dataset.
